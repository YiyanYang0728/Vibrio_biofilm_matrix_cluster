RAxML can't, parse the alignment file as phylip file 
it will now try to parse it as FASTA file

IMPORTANT WARNING: Sequences GCA_006802205.1_01694 and GCA_006802695.1_01119 are exactly identical

IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 2 sequences that are exactly identical to other sequences in the alignment.
Normally they should be excluded from the analysis.


IMPORTANT WARNING
Found 67 columns that contain only undetermined values which will be treated as missing data.
Normally these columns should be excluded from the analysis.


Just in case you might need it, a mixed model file with 
model assignments for undetermined columns removed is printed to file dna12_3.partition.txt.reduced
Just in case you might need it, an alignment file with 
sequence duplicates and undetermined columns removed is printed to file all_genes.rmdup.codon.aln.fa.reduced

Alignment has 67 completely undetermined sites that will be automatically removed from the input data

Alignment has 2846 distinct alignment patterns

Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 32.62%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 2 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
GAMMA model of rate heterogeneity, ML estimate of alpha-parameter

GAMMA Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.1000000000 Log Likelihood units
